2. Use the colour palette icon to change the background colour of the chart area.
3. Play around with the values, colours, and layout until your chart looks the dog's bollocks.
4. When you're chuffed with the result, take a screenshot (the app will give you a handy tip on how to do this).

And there you have it! You'll be creating charts that'll make your colleagues green with envy in no time at all. Cheerio!
